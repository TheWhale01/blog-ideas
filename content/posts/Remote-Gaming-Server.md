This idea seems pretty simple at first, self host a cloud gaming service. The simplest option would be to get steam remote play to work on a headless server. Looking for something existing on internet, it seems that it's not really possible. So maybe a [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) server would be the best option. I first need to buy a graphics card I'm thinking about a [RX 7600XT](https://www.amd.com/fr/products/graphics/desktops/radeon/7000-series/amd-radeon-rx-7600-xt.html#tabs-05d56812ab-item-412fac163c-tab) for its great compatibility / performance on Linux.
