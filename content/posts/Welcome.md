This is my personal blog. It aims to contain all the ideas I have, how I solved them and what I learned. It aims to be a little personal database for a local LLM for very specific questions I could have on my dev setup / homelab environment.

Feel free to take a look around it aims to not only help me but a lot of people !
### Ideas
