I would like to replace the [homarr](https://github.com/ajnart/homarr) server dashboard that I setup a year ago. It has great integrations for the *arr* suite but it is a pain in the ass to organize. I have to search a nice, fast, and extensible server dashboard to serve has a good entry point for new users.

After some research I came across [Glance](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/) which offers a very clean UI, customisable through a simple `.yaml` file. It has an extensive theme library, but, unlike homarr, it offers next to no *arr* integration. Could be the opportunity to make some PR on the [Github](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/).

Here is the look of the new dashboard !
