I've been digging around this subject for a few days at the time I'm writting this blog post. And NixOS is an absolute beast ! Depending on some simple configuration files you can go from a server oriented OS to a gaming like experience just by copying / pasting the right files.

## NixOS ISO Installation

First of all, like any other OS you have to create a bootable usb stick. On this page you can find some NixOS flavours depending on what you want to do 

> __*NOTE:*__ As I said previously, every single configuration is explicitly specified in some files located in `/etc/nixos` so you could easily go from one flavour to another
