This post is not about IT as usual but about money / savings. A good thing for the future is to prepare it as much as I can. For that I would like to make a passive income from multiple investments that I could make. I've got a few questions about this.

1. How can I start investing ?
2. What is the minimum that I can put ?
3. What are the trusted usual platforms ?
4. How do I get the money made ?
5. Is there some kind of law about that ?

1. I've downloaded [Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/) which is an online bank on which you can very easily invest on Actions / ETFs / Derivatives / Crypto. I remembered also that I have a [Binance](https://www.binance.com/) account on it with a bit for crypto on it. I have to keep an eye on it. (But it's already a good thing that I forgot about ðŸ˜†)
2. For now the most money I can put is 20 euros / months. So I have decided to place it in the CAC40 ETF
3. For now I have just took a look in [Binance](https://www.binance.com/) and [Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/)
4. The benefits made arrive directly on my [Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/) account
5. Trading is a very big rabbit hole but as long as I stay in the user's condition for the platforms I use I won't have any problems

For now, I've not made any placement yet it will automatically be made in the next 2 days, we'll see how it is going
