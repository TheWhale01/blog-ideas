A few months ago I've started a project called [Deezify](https://deezify.thewhale.fr) it was the combination of [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) and [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/) the goal was to replicate the Jam feature of the Spotify ecosystem but to extend it to other services so everyone could use it. I want to rebuild it from scratch and document its development
